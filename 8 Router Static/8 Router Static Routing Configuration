What You'll Need in Packet Tracer:
8 Routers
8-16 PCs (2 per router network or as needed)
Switches (optional depending on PC connectivity)
Straight-through cables (for PC to switch)
Serial/DCE cables (for router-to-router connections)

# 8 Router Static Routing Configuration

This project demonstrates the configuration of static routing across 8 routers using Cisco Packet Tracer. Each router is connected to its own LAN and statically configured to reach all other networks in the topology.

---

## Project Files

- `8-router-static.pkt` – Cisco Packet Tracer topology file
- `static-routing-configuration.png` – Screenshot of the topology
- This `README.md` – Detailed explanation and configuration steps

---

## Topology Overview

- 8 Routers (R1 to R8)
- Each router connects to:
  - Its own LAN (1 or 2 PCs per LAN)
  - Neighboring routers using serial connections
- Static routes are configured to allow full end-to-end communication

---

## Objectives

- Assign IP addresses to router interfaces and PCs
- Enable router interfaces
- Configure static routes between routers
- Verify connectivity across all devices

---

## Testing

Use the `ping` command from one PC to another in a different network to verify routing is working:

```sh
C:\> ping 192.168.X.X

Configuration Steps

Router> enable
Router# configure terminal
Router(config)# interface g0/0
Router(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
Router(config-if)# no shutdown

Set clock rate on DCE side of serial link (only needed on one side)
Router(config)# interface s0/0/0
Router(config-if)# clock rate 64000
Router(config-if)# ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.252
Router(config-if)# no shutdown

Configure static routing
Router(config)# ip route [DESTINATION_NETWORK] [SUBNET_MASK] [NEXT_HOP_IP]

Configure PC IPs
IP Address: 192.168.1.10
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1
